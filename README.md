WIP VR Mod for Rogue Trader, basically my old Pathfinder Kingmaker/WOTR VR code ported to the Rogue Trader built-in Unity Mod Manager Template.
Steam Workshop release soon?
Current state:
- Runs pretty OK until you load a different area

How to run VR:
- Launch the game with this mod, without a controller attached to your PC (it won't get to the main menu if it launches with a game controller (think XBOX/playstation controller) attached)
- Make it to the main menu, then connect your controller so you can load a save with the "A" button.
- Once you're past the loading screen (don't forget to press "A" again when it's done loading), press the X or Y button (i forgot) on your Oculus Touch controller to start VR rendering.
- - From here on out you can walk around using the XBOX controller.

Plans:
- Early version release on steam workshop before 2024
- [DONE] Fix the right eye thing
- Port over the latest kingmaker/WOTR VR mod code so everything works better
- [DONE?] Fix the wonky VR rendering (camera shakes too much)
